## Assignment
The assignment for Module 3 consists on the presentation of a project based on data analysis using machine learning. Once the field of interest is chosen, the research question(s) defined and the data collected, select the machine learning approach to be used to answer the research question(s). Some questions that should be considered to select the right machine learning approache are:
- what data I am using for my goal?
- do I have to merge different sources?
- am I doing supervised or unsupervised ML?
- am I doing classification or regression?
- do I have enough data to try neural networks to balance bias and variance?
